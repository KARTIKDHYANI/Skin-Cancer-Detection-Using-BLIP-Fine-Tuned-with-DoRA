# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-BLIP-Fine-Tuned-with-DoRA
Skin cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with early identification crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study presents a strategy for skin cancer detection using a fine-tuned BLIP-2 (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre- training) model, optimized via Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA).
