Expanding inputs for image tokens in BLIP-2 should be done in processing. Please follow instruction here (https://gist.github.com/zucchini-nlp/e9f20b054fa322f84ac9311d9ab67042) to update your BLIP-2 model. Using processors without these attributes in the config is deprecated and will throw an error in v4.47.
